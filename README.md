This is a Financial Dashboard Project analyzing 3 different stocks(Microsoft, Pepsico and Blackrock)

Project was built using YFinance(Yahoo Finance) API, then using an ETL Pipeline using Apache Airflow ran through Docker with a front-end of React, back-end of Flask and PostgreSQL Database

Next Steps : Incorporate a section to analyze my TFSA and RESP accounts by connecting through the Questrade API.
